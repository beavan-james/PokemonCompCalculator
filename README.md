# 🃏 Pokemon Card Price Comparator

A lightweight FastAPI service that pulls real-time sold listing data from eBay to help you make smarter buying and selling decisions on Pokémon cards.

> **Why?** Manually looking up comps on eBay is tedious. This tool automates it — giving you stats, suggested prices, and visual trends in seconds.

## Features

- **Market pricing** — calculates a suggested buy/sell price based on recent sold comps
- **Card statistics** — min, max, mean prices and market trend (Stable / Falling)
- **Raw sold listings** — returns individual sold prices with dates
- **Price chart** — generates a scatter plot (PNG) of sold price vs. date with a trend line
- **Flexible search** — filter by card name, year, set, and language
- **Best Offer filtering** — automatically skips listings where the actual sold price is unknown

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>

## How Pricing Works

1. Fetches recent sold listings from eBay (excluding Best Offer sales)
2. Calculates the **average** and **median** sold price
3. Determines market trend:
   - **Stable** — median ≥ average (prices are consistent)
   - **Falling** — median < average (outliers are pulling the average up, most cards sell for less)
4. If the trend is **Falling**, the suggested price is discounted by 5%
5. The `fee` multiplier is applied (e.g. `fee=0.7` means you want to pay 70% of the suggested price)
