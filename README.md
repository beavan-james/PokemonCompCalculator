This is a personal project to solve my issue with looking up prices on pokemon cards when trying to buy and sell.

Fee = Price that you would like to pay based off the suggested price e.g. 70% of suggest fee = 0.7

Limit = Listing limit, this # controls the amount of listings that will be displayed and parsed.
